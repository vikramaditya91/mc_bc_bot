A simple bot which replies with the choiciest [sledges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sledging_(cricket)) when summoned.


## Getting Started
To build, develop and run the bot yourself, all you need is a working version of Python and an internet connection.
Conda is installed locally, an environemnt is created and the required dependencies are pulled.
### Prerequisites

### Installing

 and pull the requirements necessary for running the bot.
 Finally, it should start the bot.
