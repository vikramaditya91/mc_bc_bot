# MC BC BOT

A simple bot which replies with the choiciest [sledges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sledging_(cricket)) when summoned.


## Getting Started
To build, develop and run the bot yourself, all you need is a working version of Python and an internet connection.
Conda is installed locally, an environemnt is created and the required dependencies are pulled.
### Prerequisites

All you need to get started is a working Python on your machine

### Installing

Just run the build.py present inside the scripts directory
```
python scripts\build.py
```
This should create a conda environment in the same directory,
 and pull the requirements necessary for running the bot.
 Finally, it should start the bot.

## Running the tests

Unittests have not been created yet.




## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
